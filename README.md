# Cosmic Conductor

A command line utility to control windows and working groups on the [COSMIC desktop](https://system76.com/cosmic/).

## Status

The COSMIC desktop is currently in alpha. Therefor it is expected for things to change and
break. This program especially depends on the [cosmic wayland protocols](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-protocols)
which are not stabalized. Therefor it is likely that functionality will break with updates
to COSMIC. 

Currently this is build against COSMIC Alpha 7.

## Changes

This project has a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
